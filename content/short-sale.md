### Short Sale

Navigating and negotiating a short sale or pre-foreclosure is not an easy task! It requires experience, knowledge, an excellent negotiating aptitude and fortitude.

As a senior manager, managing a Loss Mitigation unit for Bank of America Legacy Asset Servicing Division, along with successfully closing many short sale transactions as a successful realtor, makes me an expert concerning short sales and pre-foreclosure sales. You should not entrust your short sale or pre-foreclosure sale with any other realtor or real estate company!

My team and I have the knowledge, experience and the much needed negotiating aptitude and fortitude to properly navigate and negotiate with your lender on your behalf to get your home _SOLD,_ or your purchase _CLOSED!_

We are standing by, looking forward to working with you to get your deal **_CLOSED!_**

Please contact our client relations department at clientrelations@lifestyleca.com for more details and your **_FREE_** evaluation.

We look forward to working with you!

Antonio H. Matier | President
