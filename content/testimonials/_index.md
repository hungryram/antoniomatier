body = "“The sell of this was a very personal one for me as the Trustee of the Hall Family Estate. This was our home for 50+ years, and our Parent’s were the sole owner’s. Mr. Matier explained to us that he knew this time would be difficult for us, and he would be there for us in any way he could, and he was. Mr. Matier let us take the time we needed to prepare the property to be placed on the market/staging, and supported us when it was time to move forward with selling the property. He understood that this was personal to us and he accommodated us thru our grieving process. We were very pleased with his staff and The Title Company he works with. We highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell their property. Mr. Matier is “Top Shelf Professional” and we hope that he continues to make other sellers, buyer’s feel as pleased as we The Hall Family are”."

body = "“My experience with Antonio is best contrasted with my experience with the “first” real estate agent I’ve ever met. On a random afternoon, my GF and I went out to an Oakland open house just to check out what condos look like. The realtor there was extremely pushy and aggressive. Without really taking the time to understand what we wanted and what we were looking for, she quickly went in for the close. Antonio was recommended to me by Boyd, a loan officer that my friend used (whom I also recommended). I met with him and was happy with how friendly and jolly he was from the get go. We went to check out the same first house we were interested in and he told us he thought it was a good value (he has never seen it before). But as we were mulling over whether or not we were going to purchase, he drove us around Oakland, a town we really have never seen before. He took the time to show case the amazing culture of the town and some of the major landmarks. That drive is really what sold us on the condo, as we fell in love with the city we saw. Being a pretty manic individual, I was very appreciative of the patience Antonio had with me. When things were stressful for me, he always took the time to calm me down and help manage my emotions”.\n\nI look forward to working with Antonio more in the future, as I do plan on buying another condo soon!"

He and I had an excellent working rapport throughout a challenging six months of house-hunting, house-buying, and house-fixing-up. Despite sometimes difficult conditions, he remained cheerful, calm, focused, patient, and helpful – all the characteristics one wants in an agent. His company byline of “It’s not business as usual…it’s a relationship” was certainly borne out with me. We spent a lot of time discussing the type of house I wanted, the financial constraints I had to work with, and the ins and outs of the bidding process. Antonio was always responsive and never pushy. He listened carefully to what I wanted, and together we went out and got it.\n\nThe challenges Antonio encountered in my particular case were major. First, the market in the East Bay was heating up rapidly just as I was entering. The changing market conditions meant we needed to move quickly and be flexible. Antonio was great with both those requirements, helping me understand how to change strategy in order to capture what I wanted.\n\nSecond, he and I had to communicate long-distance deal – with me 9,000 miles and ten time zones away. Despite this distance, I was able to work closely with Antonio via telephone and e-mail. He always made himself available for calls and we talked as long as I needed. I never had to wait long for an answer to my e-mails.\n\nFinally, not only did Antonio have to work with me and take into account my needs and desires for a house, he also had to work with my sister and nephew who had their own sets of requirements. Antonio juggled the three distinct agendas with due care and sensitivity. Although my sister and nephew live locally, Antonio still had to coordinate viewing of houses with them. He was always willing to accommodate their scheduling needs.\n\nLast but not least, it was a surprise and pleasure when Antonio explained that he would continue to work with me to get the house repaired after we purchased it. Given my distance from the Bay Area, this has proven crucial. Antonio found contractors for everything from earthquake retrofitting to electrical upgrades to hard-wood floor refinishing. Not only has he identified the specialists, but he has set up estimate appointments, and walked workers through the house, pointing out what needs to be done. He explained to me that this is part of his “concierge service,” and that he will keep helping us until we move in. This was an unexpected bonus of working with California Homes It’s A Lifestyle, but one that has proven invaluable.\n\nAll in all, I can say that Antonio knows the Bay area market very well and will work with clients to find out what they’re looking for and then go after it. He was always upbeat, never discouraged, and looked out for my best interests through several rounds of bidding. Later, after closing, he found a $100 mistake that the title company had made and asked for and obtained a refund for me. You will be in good hands with Antonio”."
