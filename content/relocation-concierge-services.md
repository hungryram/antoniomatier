**Clients have said the following about our _“Concierge Services”:_**

“Last but not least, it was a surprise and pleasure when Antonio explained that he would continue to work with me to get the house repaired after we purchased it. Given my distance from the Bay Area, this has proven crucial. Antonio found contractors for everything from earthquake retrofitting to electrical upgrades to hard-wood floor refinishing. Not only has he identified the specialists, but he has set up estimate appointments, and walked workers through the house, pointing out what needs to be done. He explained to me that this is part of his “concierge service,” and that he will keep helping us until we move in. This was an unexpected bonus of working with California Homes It’s A Lifestyle, but one that has proven invaluable.” **_(verbiage taken from a clients thank you letter written May 12, 2014, which can be read in its entirety on our website at_** [www.lifestyleca.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20190415122401/http://www.antoniomatier.com/) under tab labeled “client relations” then “client testimonials”
